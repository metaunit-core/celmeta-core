# 📌 License Summary

This repository is **not open source**. It is currently shared for system demonstration, academic review, and structural iteration purposes only.  
**Cloning, forking, copying, or structurally replicating any part of this system is not permitted.**

This project represents a **prototype of a structural learning engine**, integrating AI self-driven learning, medicine, multilingual cognition, and expressive logic. It is part of a long-term personal cognitive experiment and system design endeavor.

## 📐 Protected Content

The following elements are original and protected under structural copyright:

- System names and modular architecture: Celmeta, LXOS, Celenix, Echo, FDEE, Loopbase, SELFOS, MAI
- Step 0–7 execution framework and its modular paths
- All structural diagrams, learning flow templates, expression frameworks, and task cards
- Logic mechanisms of Echo × FDEE × LoopBase × SELFOS
- Expression chain systems such as Output Zone revival, FDEE upgrade paths, and feedback generation logic

⚠️ This system is a continuously evolving structural expression engine. It is experimental in nature and contains original logic pathways. Any unauthorized replication or adaptation for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited.

## 🔒 Permitted Use

- **Personal learning and inspirational reference only**
- Forking, re-distribution, structural citation, or copying of expression mechanisms is **not permitted**
- Academic discussions or structural interviews are **allowed only with explicit permission** and proper attribution
  
📌 This project reflects proprietary structural work from ongoing intellectual development.  

Any reuse or derivative work without **explicit written permission** is prohibited.  

Citing structure without attribution is considered academic misconduct.
